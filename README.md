# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analytics-Project-GMIT-2018

This repository contains, primarily, a Jupyter notebook which investigates and explains box plots.

The repository also contains:
Box-plot.png  (an image of a boxplot)
AthenryMonthlyWeather.csv (the dataset used to create the boxplots)

Both files are linked from github directly to the notebook. So you do not need to download them with 
the jupyter notebook.

To run the notebook, you must have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine.
You can install this using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution.

The notebook itself is called `Boxplot.ipynb`
